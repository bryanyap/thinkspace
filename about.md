Hi, I'm Bryan. I help clients design, develop and build business system integrations to simplify their internal processes.

Currently, I am a Solutions Consultant at [{{ site.current_company.name }}]({{ site.current_company.url }}) where I've collaborated with companies like [Slack](https://www.slack.com), [Arlo](https://www.arlo.com) and [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com) to build better experiences for their employees as well as to enhance the way they work with data.

My specialties include application integration, business process automation and data warehousing.
